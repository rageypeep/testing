# Testing
## For testing random ideas

Most of the componetns here are me trying to work out how things I have seen on various work and have ago at copying them using React.


### VideoPlayer.js
I have often wondered how YouTube does its background glow on its videos, this React script scans a <canvas> tag then updates the videoContainer with the average colour by changing the CSS box shadow value.

### Voxel.js
I am messing around with voxels, something I haven't done before in a browser, trying to make a 3D sphere as smooth as I can without tanking the FPS.
